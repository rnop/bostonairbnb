### Motivation

<p>Airbnb has given the opportunity for millions of people to connect all over the world. One of the core values of Airbnb is to make people feel that they could "belong anywhere." Airbnb gives people the ability to travel all over the world and bring people from different places, cultures, and backgrounds together so that they can experience the world in a place that isn't necessary their home, but feels like home.</p>
<p>The motivation behind this project is to create data-driven solutions to solve problems of Airbnb travelers and hosts in Boston:</p>
<ul>
<li>What time of the year are Airbnb prices in Boston the highest and lowest?</li>
<li>Which neighborhoods in Boston are more expensive to rent than others?</li>
<li>Can we predict prices based on the time of year and features of the Airbnb?</li>
</ul>
<h2>Python Libraries</h2>
<ul>
<li>Pandas</li>
<li>NumPy</li>
<li>Matplotlib</li>
<li>Seaborn</li>
<li>Scikit-Learn</li>
<li>XGBoost</li>
</ul>
<h2>Repo Contents</h2>
<p>The <strong>boston-airbnb</strong> jupyter notebook boston-airbnb attempts to follow the CRISP-DM framework for analysis.</p>
<p>The datasets are located in the <strong>data</strong> folder and their descriptions:</p>
